            <h2>Original Interface</h2>

                <span class="original-interface-text">
                    <span class="og-text">The &quot;Lessons&quot; page of the Buckskill Tennis Club leads you to 
                    believe that you can book a lesson online, despite this functionality 
                    not being enabled, confusing the user. It has a daily schedule on the 
                    side and an age-specific schedule (e.g. a schedule of just junior 
                    clinics, for example) on the bottom of each sub-page. Visually, the 
                    website incorporates several different fonts and colors and generally looks dated.

                <h2>Evaluation of Existing Interface</h2>
                <h3>Usability</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li class="outer-list"> Visibility of System Status
                        <ul>

                                Pages that are loading provide no indication to 
                                the user that they are doing so, causing the user 
                                to believe that the website did not register their 
                                click and potentially try to repeat the same action 
                                multiple times. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>    
                    </li>

                                Language used does not match convention or user 
                                expectations &mdash; for example, the page titled &quot;Buy Online&quot; 
                                enables you to purchase packs of private lessons, 
                                clinics, or memberships, however, it doesn&apos;t enable you 
                                to actually book them on the website but instead requires 
                                you to call the club. I initially thought this page was an 
                                online store for club-branded apparel and other tennis equipment. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                Redundancy of information &mdash; nearly every 
                                page has a side bar with a mini schedule 
                                (despite having a dedicated schedule page and 
                                schedules on each of the sub-pages for the different 
                                types of clinics), enabling booking from almost every page, etc.
                            </li>
                            <li class="inner-list">
                                Many of the buttons on the page just look like regular text 
                                until you hover over them, creating confusion. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                Buckskill&apos;s website makes use of at least two different fonts. 
                                There are many different levels of headers, differentiated by font size, 
                                font color, font weighting, highlighting/banners, etc. This unclear 
                                hierarchy creates many sections which are constantly competing for the user&apos;s attention.
                            </li>
                            <li class="inner-list">
                                The website contains much extraneous information. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                </ul>
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>The WebAIM Wave Report showed that the page as a 
                    whole was missing a language, did not have page 
                    regions or ARIA landmarks, and lacked a first level 
                    heading. It also showed that images were missing 
                    alternative text. There were three redundant links, 
                    as the three sub-pages under the Facilities tab all 
                    linked to the same page. There was also one empty 
                    link and one broken link. </p>
